# Resource_Distributions_and_Contacts
This repository contains the analysis for an experiment exploring how resource distributions affect snail contact rates.

## To Do List
+ Get Rowan on Github
+ Load data
+ Dig up old code to turn contact observations into number of contacts per snail
+ Plot density vs. contacts for each distribution
+ Plot: was there a trial effect?
+ Data cleaning: adjust densities for dead snails and re-plot
+ Data cleaning: Skylar check the times on the check time snails
