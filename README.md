# Resource_Distributions_and_Contacts
This repository contains the analysis for an experiment exploring how resource distributions affect snail contact rates.

## To Do List
+ Get Rowan on Github
+ Load data
+ Data cleaning: do we need to adjust any densities?
+ Plot density vs. contacts for each distribution
+ Plot: was there a trial effect?
